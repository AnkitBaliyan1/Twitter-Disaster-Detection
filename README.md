# Twitter Disaster Prediction Model

## Overview

This project focuses on the development of a classification model that predicts the occurrence of a disaster based on Twitter data. The dataset has undergone extensive data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure the model's effectiveness. The goal is to accurately classify tweets as either related to a disaster or not.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

1. **Data**: This directory contains the dataset used for training and testing the classification model. It includes both the features (tweets) and the target variable (disaster-related or not).

2. **Notebooks**: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks that walk through the different stages of the project, from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation. The notebooks are organized as follows:

   - **01_Data_Cleaning_and_Preprocessing.ipynb**: Data preprocessing steps, including text cleaning, tokenization, and feature engineering. This notebook also handles missing values and outlier detection.

   - **02_Model_Training.ipynb**: Model training, hyperparameter tuning, and cross-validation. Various classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, LSTM) are implemented and evaluated.

   - **03_Model_Evaluation.ipynb**: Model evaluation, including metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. Visualizations of results are also provided.

3. **Scripts**: This directory contains Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. These scripts can be used for batch processing or automation of specific tasks.

4. **Results**: This directory contains saved model files, evaluation metrics, and visualizations generated during the project. It provides a reference for the best-performing models.

5. **Requirements.txt**: This file lists all the Python libraries and dependencies required to run the project successfully. You can create a virtual environment and install these dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

6. **README.md**: This README file that you are currently reading provides an overview of the project, its objectives, and the project structure.

## Important Notes

- Text data can be challenging to work with, and the success of the model heavily depends on the quality of data preprocessing. The cleaning and tokenization steps are crucial for building a robust model.

- A variety of classification algorithms have been explored in this project. You can experiment with different models and choose the one that performs best for your specific use case.

- Model evaluation metrics, such as precision, recall, and F1-score, provide insights into the model's performance. The choice of the evaluation metric should align with the project's objectives and priorities.

- Before deploying the model in a real-world application, consider issues related to data privacy, ethics, and the potential impact of false predictions.
