# NLP based Twitter Disaster Prediction Model

## Overview

This project is a disaster prediction model based on Twitter data. The model is designed to analyze tweets and classify them as either disaster-related or not. It aims to provide early detection and monitoring of potential disasters or emergencies by leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

## Usage

To use the disaster prediction model, follow these steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Collect Twitter data using appropriate methods (see [Data Collection](#data-collection) section).

2. **Data Cleaning**: Preprocess the collected data (see [Data Cleaning](#data-cleaning) section).

3. **Model Training**: Train the prediction model using the preprocessed data (see [Model Training](#model-training) section).

4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance (see [Model Evaluation](#model-evaluation) section).

5. **Results**: Interpret and utilize the model's predictions (see [Results](#results) section).

## Data Collection

Explain how you collected Twitter data for this project. Mention any APIs, scripts, or tools used. Provide instructions or scripts for others to replicate this process if possible.

## Data Cleaning

Detail the steps taken to clean and preprocess the Twitter data. Include information about how you handled missing values, text normalization, tokenization, and any other data preprocessing steps.

## Model Training

Explain how the disaster prediction model was trained. Provide details about the machine learning or deep learning algorithms used, hyperparameters, and any techniques employed to enhance the model's performance.

## Model Evaluation

Describe how the model's performance was evaluated. Include metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Mention any validation techniques used, such as cross-validation.

## Results

Present the results of your disaster prediction model. Discuss the model's strengths, limitations, and potential applications. Provide examples or visualizations to illustrate its performance.
